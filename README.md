what is this? 
* it's the first beta version of a framework that is being made specially for blindly attacking hosts generated by the hackers search engine "shodan" in an automated way .
* this framework is "neutral" ie: it's not based on shodan API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what  you can do with it is your immagination & programming skills .
