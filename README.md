# BAF 0.1.0
Blind Attacking Framework

version [0.1.0] --> [(public releases).(beta versions).(bugfixes patches)]

what is BAF ? 
* it's a framework written in python that is being made specially for blind attacking, ie : attacking random targets with common security issues, targets are generated by the hackers search engine "shodan" and vulnerable hosts are hacked in an automated way .

* this framework is "neutral" ie: it's not based on shodan API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what  you can do with it is your immagination & our programming skills .   

how to use BAF ?
