# BAF
Blind Attacking Framework (beta version 0.0.1.1)

what is this? 
* it's the first beta version of a framework that is being made specially for blindly attacking hosts generated by the hackers search engine "shodan" in an automated way .
* this framework is "neutral" ie: it's not based on shodan API and it has total dependence on web scraping , ie: the only limit on what  you can do with it is your immagination & programming capabilities .   

TODO list 

- [x] custom search that exports the targets ips / open ports to text file for custom attacks  
- [x] serially open admin/admin webcams login pages
- [ ] penetrating common services telnet,ssh, etc of the hosts with default credentials
